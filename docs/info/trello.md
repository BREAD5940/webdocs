# Programming Trello
In the [Trello board](https://trello.com/invite/b/CygCH0Ky/477b7321b12e94f3e752a535a5099675/offseason-project-board), we both keep track of tasks and also plan meetings. Check the board frequently to make sure you know what has been assigned to you. If you need help on a task, add the `Requires Assistance` tag.
