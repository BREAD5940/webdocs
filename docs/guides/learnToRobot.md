# Learning how to program a robot

If you're reading this, it's probably your first time programming a robot. Congratulations. You are indeed cool.

Before coding a robot, you should already have a background in Object Oriented Programming of some kind. If not, refer to (TODO LINK OR SMTH)

We currently program our robots in Kotlin, a new language written for the Java Virtual Machine. It's similar to Java, with a focus on being more concise, null safe and interoperable with other JVM languages such as Java. We also use the Kotlin DSL for Gradle in our build scripts. Learn to code it at https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/, or [the X in Y minutes writeup](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/kotlin/). It's not necessary to know Kotlin in order to learn how to program (it's sometimes easier to learn about robot code and then learn Kotlin), but it's encouraged to know it in addition to Java. An example Kotlin codebase is avalible for download [here](docs/resources/Kotlin-Example-Code.zip)

If you already know OO Java/Kotlin, you're ready to get started messing with real robot code. Documentation of WPILib, the framework we use to program robots, is available [on FRC-docs](https://frc-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
